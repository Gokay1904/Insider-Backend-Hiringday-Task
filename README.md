# Insider-Backend-Hiringday-Task

A Go-based backend project demonstrating API development and SQLite database integration.  
Includes custom routing and HTTP server setup as part of the Insider Development Intern Hiring Day case study.

---

## üöÄ Introduction

This project implements a backend system to simulate a football league. The system fulfills the following requirements:

- Store team and match data in a structured format.  
- Simulate match results based on the relative strength of the teams.  
- Simulate matches on a **weekly** basis according to a schedule.  
- Provide an API to retrieve current league standings in real-time.  
- Include functionality to reset the system for a new simulation.

All weekly simulation logic is implemented using the Go programming language, simulating one match week at a time and updating team statistics accordingly.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Solution Structure

The backend is organized into several packages to ensure clean separation of concerns:

handlers/
  match_handler.go       # Match simulation endpoint
  table_handler.go       # Standings retrieval endpoint

models/
  interface.go           # Interface definitions
  match.go               # Match model
  team.go                # Team model

router/
  router.go              # HTTP router setup

services/
  match_service.go       # Business logic for matches
  simulation_service.go  # Match result calculation
  table_service.go       # Standings and table logic

league.db                # SQLite database file
reset.sql                # SQL script to reset DB (truncate matches and standings)
main.go                  # Application entry point
go.mod                   # Go module file
go.sum                   # Go module dependencies
Dockerfile               # Docker container configuration


- `handlers/` ‚Üí HTTP handlers for API endpoints (`/match`, `/standings`)  
- `services/` ‚Üí Business logic for simulations and league table calculations  
- `models/` ‚Üí Data structures such as Team and Match  
- `router/` ‚Üí Router setup and HTTP endpoint registration  
- `league.db` ‚Üí SQLite database storing all league data  
- `reset.sql` ‚Üí SQL script to reset the database for a new simulation

## üß† Simulation Logic

- Each team has a **strength score**, derived from actual Premier League performance.  
- Matches are simulated **weekly**, with outcomes influenced by team strength.  
- League standings update automatically after every simulated week.

---

## üèüÔ∏è Database Design

SQLite3 is used for data persistence. The database is managed and verified with **DB Browser for SQLite**.

### Tables

| Table Name | Columns                                                                                                                | Description                         |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **teams**  | `id` (INTEGER, PK, AUTOINCREMENT), `name` (TEXT, NOT NULL), `position` (INTEGER), `played` (INTEGER), `won` (INTEGER), `drawn` (INTEGER), `lost` (INTEGER), `gf` (INTEGER), `ga` (INTEGER), `gd` (INTEGER), `points` (INTEGER), `strength` (INTEGER, NOT NULL) | Stores team info and stats         |
| **matches**| `id` (INTEGER, PK, AUTOINCREMENT), `week` (INTEGER, NOT NULL), `home_team_id` (INTEGER, FK), `away_team_id` (INTEGER, FK), `home_goals` (INTEGER), `away_goals` (INTEGER), `result` (TEXT) | Stores match info and results      |

---
#### `teams` Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE teams (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    position INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    played INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    won INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    drawn INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    lost INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    gf INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    ga INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    gd INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    points INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    strength INTEGER NOT NULL
);
```

#### `matches` Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE matches (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    week INTEGER NOT NULL,
    home_team_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    away_team_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    home_goals INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    away_goals INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    result TEXT,
    FOREIGN KEY(home_team_id) REFERENCES teams(id),
    FOREIGN KEY(away_team_id) REFERENCES teams(id)
);
```

## üöÄ Available Endpoints

| Endpoint         | Method | Description                   | Request Body | Response                    |
|------------------|--------|------------------------------|--------------|-----------------------------|
| `/simulate/week` | POST   | Simulates next week's matches | None         | JSON: Simulated matches     |
| `/simulate/all`  | POST   | Simulates all remaining weeks | None         | JSON: All simulated matches |
| `/standings`     | GET    | Returns current league table  | None         | JSON: Team standings        |
| `/reset`         | POST   | Resets all matches and stats  | None         | Plain text confirmation     |

### How to Call Endpoints with `curl`

- **Simulate a specific week**

To play weekly
  ```bash
  curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/simulate/week?week=2"
  ```

To simulate all
   ```bash
  curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/simulate/all"
  ```

To reset matches

 ```bash
  curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/reset
  ```


## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Running the Project (Without Docker)

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine:

### Prerequisites

- **Go** installed (version 1.18 or higher recommended)  
  Download from: https://golang.org/dl/  
- **SQLite3** installed (for database management)  
  Download from: https://sqlite.org/download.html  
- (Optional) A SQLite database browser like **DB Browser for SQLite** for inspecting and managing the database visually  
  https://sqlitebrowser.org/

---

### Step 1: Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd Insider-Backend-Hiringday-Task
```

### Step 2: Install Go dependencies

Run the following command in the project root to download all necessary Go modules:

```bash
go mod tidy
```

### Step 3: Prepare the SQLite database

Make sure `sqlite3` is installed on your system.

Run the following command to initialize or reset the database using the provided SQL script:

```bash
sqlite3 league.db < reset.sql
```

Create tables under league database with teams and matches:
```bash
sqlite3 league.db < schema.sql
```

Seed the team data for example: Arsenal, starting score, previous matches, strength etc.)
```bash
sqlite3 league.db < seed.sql
```

### Step 4: Run the Backend Server

Start the backend application by running the following command in the project root directory:

```bash
go run main.go
```
This will start the server which will be listen on:
http://localhost:8080


### Step 5: Test the API Endpoints

You can test the backend API using `curl` commands or any API client like Postman or Insomnia.

To play weekly (for example week = 2)
  ```bash
  curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/simulate/week?week=2"
  ```

To simulate all
   ```bash
  curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/simulate/all"
  ```

To manually reset matches

 ```bash
  curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/reset
  ```


### Output examples:

First predictions:
```yaml
Week 1 - Championship Predictions
Arsenal: 30.00
Manchester United: 25.00
Manchester City: 20.00
Chelsea: 15.00
Liverpool: 10.00

   ```

Then the match results:
   ```yaml
Week 1 - Match Results
- match:
    home_team: Arsenal
    away_team: Chelsea
    home_goals: 2
    away_goals: 1
- match:
    home_team: Liverpool
    away_team: Manchester United
    home_goals: 0
    away_goals: 3
- bye: Manchester City

   ```
Finally the team scores after the match is played:

  ```yaml
teams:
  - name: Team A
    stats:
      Played: 1
      Won: 1
      Drawn: 0
      Lost: 0
      GF: 3
      GA: 1
      GoalDiff: 2
      Points: 3

  - name: Team B
    stats:
      Played: 1
      Won: 0
      Drawn: 0
      Lost: 1
      GF: 1
      GA: 3
      GoalDiff: -2
      Points: 0

 ```
