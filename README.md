# Insider-Backend-Hiringday-Task
A Go-based backend project demonstrating API development and SQLite database integration. Includes custom routing and HTTP server setup as part of the Insider Development Intern Hiring Day case study.

Introduction

Study Problem:

The objective is to implement a backend system that simulates a football league. The system is expected to handle the following tasks:

Store team and match data in a structured format.

Simulate match results based on the relative strength of the teams.

Simulate matches on a weekly basis, following a schedule.

Provide an API that returns the current league standings in real-time.

Include functionality to reset the system for a new simulation.

Additionally, all optional logic related to weekly simulations must be implemented using the Go programming language. This includes simulating one match week at a time, updating team statistics accordingly, and ensuring integration with the rest of the backend system.
