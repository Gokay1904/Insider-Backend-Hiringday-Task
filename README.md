# Insider-Backend-Hiringday-Task

A Go-based backend project demonstrating API development and SQLite database integration.  
Includes custom routing and HTTP server setup as part of the Insider Development Intern Hiring Day case study.

---

## üöÄ Introduction

This project implements a backend system to simulate a football league. The system fulfills the following requirements:

- Store team and match data in a structured format.  
- Simulate match results based on the relative strength of the teams.  
- Simulate matches on a **weekly** basis according to a schedule.  
- Provide an API to retrieve current league standings in real-time.  
- Include functionality to reset the system for a new simulation.

All weekly simulation logic is implemented using the Go programming language, simulating one match week at a time and updating team statistics accordingly.

## üèóÔ∏è Solution Structure

The backend is organized into several packages to ensure clean separation of concerns:

handlers/
  match_handler.go       # Match simulation endpoint
  table_handler.go       # Standings retrieval endpoint

models/
  interface.go           # Interface definitions
  match.go               # Match model
  team.go                # Team model

router/
  router.go              # HTTP router setup

services/
  match_service.go       # Business logic for matches
  simulation_service.go  # Match result calculation
  table_service.go       # Standings and table logic

league.db                # SQLite database file
reset.sql                # SQL script to reset DB (truncate matches and standings)
main.go                  # Application entry point
go.mod                   # Go module file
go.sum                   # Go module dependencies

## üß† Simulation Logic

- Each team has a **strength score**, derived from actual Premier League performance.  
- Matches are simulated **weekly**, with outcomes influenced by team strength.

### ‚û§ Normalize Team Strength
Each team's strength is scaled between 0 and 1:

- `homeFactor = homeStrength / 100`
- `awayFactor = awayStrength / 100`

### ‚û§ Calculate Expected Goals
Expected goals (Œª) are computed using team strength and home advantage:

- `homeLambda = 1.8 * homeFactor`
- `awayLambda = 1.0 * awayFactor`

### ‚û§ Simulate Goals with Poisson Distribution
The number of goals is sampled using the Poisson distribution:

- `P(k; Œª) = (e^-Œª * Œª^k) / k!`

Where:
- `P(k; Œª)` is the probability of scoring exactly `k` goals
- `Œª` is the expected goal count for that team

### ‚û§ Score Limiting
To ensure realism, the number of goals is capped at **5 per team**.

- League standings update automatically after every simulated week.

## üèüÔ∏è Database Design

SQLite3 is used for data persistence. The database is managed and verified with **DB Browser for SQLite**.

### Tables

| Table Name | Columns                                                                                                                | Description                         |

## üöÄ Available Endpoints

| Endpoint         | Method | Description                   | Request Body | Response                    |
|------------------|--------|------------------------------|--------------|-----------------------------|
| `/simulate/week` | POST   | Simulates next week's matches | None         | JSON: Simulated matches     |
| `/simulate/all`  | POST   | Simulates all remaining weeks | None         | JSON: All simulated matches |
| `/standings`     | GET    | Returns current league table  | None         | JSON: Team standings        |
| `/reset`         | POST   | Resets all matches and stats  | None         | Plain text confirmation     |

---

üìù Note: All match results and league updates triggered by these endpoints are automatically persisted in the SQLite database (league.db) under the teams and matches tables.

### How to Call Endpoints with `curl`

- **Simulate a specific week**

To play weekly
  ```bash
  curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/simulate/week?week=2"
  ```

To simulate all
   ```bash
  curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/simulate/all"
  ```

To reset matches

 ```bash
  curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/reset
  ```


## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Running the Project (Without Docker)

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine:

### Prerequisites

- **Go** installed (version 1.18 or higher recommended)  
  Download from: https://golang.org/dl/  
- **SQLite3** installed (for database management)  
  Download from: https://sqlite.org/download.html  
- (Optional) A SQLite database browser like **DB Browser for SQLite** for inspecting and managing the database visually  
  https://sqlitebrowser.org/

---

### Step 1: Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd Insider-Backend-Hiringday-Task
```

### Step 2: Install Go dependencies

Run the following command in the project root to download all necessary Go modules:

```bash
go mod tidy
```

### Step 3: Prepare the SQLite database

Make sure `sqlite3` is installed on your system.

Run the following command to initialize or reset the database using the provided SQL script:

```bash
sqlite3 league.db < reset.sql
```

Create tables under league database with teams and matches:
```bash
sqlite3 league.db < schema.sql
```

At the start of the simulation, each team‚Äîsuch as Arsenal‚Äîis initialized with predefined attributes including starting scores, match history (if applicable), and a strength rating. This seed data represents the initial conditions for each team and can be easily adjusted to simulate different league dynamics or difficulty levels.
```bash
sqlite3 league.db < seed.sql
```

### Step 4: Run the Backend Server

Start the backend application by running the following command in the project root directory:

```bash
go run main.go
```
This will start the server which will be listen on:
http://localhost:8080


### Step 5: Test the API Endpoints

You can test the backend API using `curl` commands or any API client like Postman or Insomnia.

To play weekly (for example week = 2)
  ```bash
  curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/simulate/week?week=2"
  ```

To simulate all
   ```bash
  curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/simulate/all"
  ```

To manually reset matches

 ```bash
  curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/reset
  ```


### Output examples:

First predictions:
```yaml
Week 1 - Championship Predictions
Arsenal: 30.00
Manchester United: 25.00
Manchester City: 20.00
Chelsea: 15.00
Liverpool: 10.00

   ```

Then the match results:
   ```yaml
Week 1 - Match Results
- match:
    home_team: Arsenal
    away_team: Chelsea
    home_goals: 2
    away_goals: 1
- match:
    home_team: Liverpool
    away_team: Manchester United
    home_goals: 0
    away_goals: 3
- bye: Manchester City

   ```
Finally the team scores after the match is played:

  ```yaml
teams:
  - name: Team A
    stats:
      Played: 1
      Won: 1
      Drawn: 0
      Lost: 0
      GF: 3
      GA: 1
      GoalDiff: 2
      Points: 3

  - name: Team B
    stats:
      Played: 1
      Won: 0
      Drawn: 0
      Lost: 1
      GF: 1
      GA: 3
      GoalDiff: -2
      Points: 0

 ```
